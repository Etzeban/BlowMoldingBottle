<h1>Design blow mold for water bottles</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I managed a team of 5 students to construct blow-molding molds to create the plastic bottles. The bottles would be independently selected by each group, on the condition that the volume of bottle is between 100 ml (about 3.38 oz) to 330 ml (about 11.16 oz).
